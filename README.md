## Introduction
Neural Style Transfer is a technique in deep learning where the style of one image is applied to the content of another image to create a new, stylized image. This project uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to achieve this transfer by minimizing the content and style loss functions.

## Features
- Transfer artistic styles from a style image to a content image.
- Use pre-trained VGG19 network for feature extraction.
- Customize the level of style and content blending.
- Supports high-resolution images.


### Arguments
- `--content_image`: Path to the content image.
- `--style_image`: Path to the style image.
- `--output_image`: Path to save the output image.
- `--iterations`: Number of iterations for optimization (default: 1000).
## Examples
Here are some examples of the Neural Style Transfer results:
